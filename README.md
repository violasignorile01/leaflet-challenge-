Level 1: Basic Visualization

First task is to visualize an earthquake dataset 

1. Get your data - The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.

2. Import and Visualize data

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

*Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

*Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

*Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
